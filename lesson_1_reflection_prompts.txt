How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to spot the "spacr" while comparing the contents per line of the 2 files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be easier to retract to any version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are it helps to club logically similar changes together as one commit. The cons are the commit may be look too small or too large compared to automatic.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To save time. It makes sense to commit multiple files together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log tells the complete history of a file and git diff tells the details between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is easier to find where a bug got introduced so I feel comfortable making changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use Git for my next course.
